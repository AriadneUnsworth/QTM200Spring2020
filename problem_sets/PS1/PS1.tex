%\item 
%Write down the first name, last name, and email address of all group members.
%\item
%Discuss what makes a lab group work well together.  List three things that you all agree to do for your QTM 100 lab group.
%\item
%Come up with a lab group name.
%\item
%Explore the \hlstd{yrbss2013} data set.  Report 5 different facts OR 3 different facts and 1 figure (with an interpretation or explanation) from this data set \underline{and} the R commands that you used to produce the information.  You should use the ``QTM 100 R Cheat Sheet'' in the Lab section of Blackboard for help - the \emph{Working with Data}, \emph{Summary Statistics}, and \emph{Figures} section will have useful commands.   
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item
%  \emph{Example for a fact:}
%  \item[]
%  R code: \begin{verbatim}
%    mean(yrbss2013$height_m)
%    \end{verbatim}
%  \item[]
%  Result: The average height is 1.69 meters.
%  \item
%  \emph{Example for a figure:}
%  \item[]
%  R code: \begin{verbatim}
%    plot(yrbss2013$height_m,yrbss2013$weight_kg)
%    \end{verbatim}
%  \item[]
%  Result: This command produces a scatterplot that shows the relationship between height in meters and weight in kilograms, which demonstrates a positive trend.\\

%\subsection*{The Data: Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System}

%The \href{http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/index.htm}{Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)} has been conducted every two years since 1991 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in order to obtain information from adolescents regarding trends in risky behavior, such as smoking, drinking, drug use, diet, and physical activity.  In 2013, 47 states participated in this school-based survey, yielding 13,583 respondents and 213 variables.   Full survey and data documentation can be accessed on the CDC \href{http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/data/index.htm}{website}.  A subset of this data set which has no missing data for 17 selected variables is provided in the file \texttt{yrbss2013.csv}\footnote{The variables \hlstd{days\textunderscore smoke} and \hlstd{days\textunderscore drink} were originally coded in categories of `0 days', `1 or 2 days', `3 to 5 days', `6 to 9 days', `10 to 19 days', `20 to 29 days', and `All 30 days'.  The values provided in this data set were randomly generated according to the category specified.}.\\

%\subsection*{Background}
%Food server's tips in restaurants may be influenced by
%many factors including the nature of the restaurant,
%size of the party, table locations in the restaurant, ... To
%make appropriate assignments (which tables the food
%server waits on) for the food servers, restaurant
%managers need to know what these factors are.
%In one restaurant, a food server recorded the following
%data on all customers they had served during a interval
%of two and a half months in early 1990, resulting in
%observations on 244 dining parties.

\item
A private school counselor was curious about the average of IQ of the students in her school and took a random sample of 25 students' IQ scores. The following is the data set
\begin{verbatim}
  y < -c(105,69,86,100,82,111,104,110,87,108,87,90,94,113,112, 
     98,80,97,95,111,114,89,95,126,98)
    \end{verbatim}
Find a 90\% confidence interval for the student IQ in the school assuming the population of IQ from which our random sample has been selected is normally distributed. 


\item
A private school counselor was curious  whether  the average of IQ of the students in her school is higher than the average IQ score 100 among all the schools in the country. She took a random sample of 25 students' IQ scores. The following is the data set
\begin{verbatim}
  y <- c(105,69,86,100,82,111,104,110,87,108,87,90,94,113,112, 
     98,80,97,95,111,114,89,95,126,98)
    \end{verbatim}
Conduct a test with 0.05 significance level assuming the population of IQ from which our random sample has been selected is normally distributed. 

\item
Assume $y$ is variable with values 1,2,3,4 standing for ``Freshman", ``Sophomore", ``Junior", and ``Senior", convert $y$ from numbers to characters in \texttt{R}:
