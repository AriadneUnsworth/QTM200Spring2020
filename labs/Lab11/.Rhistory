## Layout (Four windows):
# Editor: Top left window. This is where you type R code to solve the exercises in this course.
# Console: Bottom left window. The output of your code is displayed.
# Workspace: Top right window. You can see a history of your commands and see all active objects.
# Top bottom window. You can see plots, list of packages, additional information, and so on.
# Show some of the graphics that R can produce
demo("graphics")
## Running R code
# To send a line of code to your console, use either
# (PC users:) "control + enter"
# (Mac users:) "command + return"
# You can also simply copy and paste the line of code.
# You can also use "Run" button to execute a single line of code and "Source" button to execute all the codes.
print("Hello world")
## 1.3: R as a calculator
# Basic arithmatic
2 + 3  #addition
2*3  # multiplication
5/3 #division
4 - 5 #subtraction
3^3 # exponents
# modular arithmatic (11 mod 2)
11%% 2
# The integer part of a fraction
31 %/% 7
7*4
# R comes with a number of constants pre-stored that you can use
6.25 # numbers
pi # And a few others
NA # Missing value
NULL # Nothing.
0/0 # NaN means "Not a number"
1/0 # Inf means infinity
## 1.4: Objects and named storage
# The "<-" and "=" symbols are used to assign a variable to a value.
# My personal preference is "<-".
# Create a and b that take on the values of 7 and 8.
a <- 7
b = 8
# Print the values.
print(a)
print(b)
# or simply
a
b
## more example:
total.votes.ak <-  238307
voting.age.population.ak <- 496387
turnout.ak <-total.votes.ak/voting.age.population.ak
turnout.ak

# some being categorical
# 2. Correctly interpret coefficients
# Socio-economic data was collected for both smokers and non-smokers
# Each respondent reported their age, how much they smoked, and gender
# A model was fitted to the data using "amtWeekdays" as the response,
# and income and gender as predictors
# Note: A dummy variable Di was created with female=0 and male=1
# Consider the common-slope model:
#  Yi = 尾0+ 尾ageXi + 尾genderDi + 蔚i
# load and/or download necessary packages

# (1) What is the fitted model for men?
# (2) What is the fitted model for women?
# (3) Based on the estimated coefficients, does it look like men or women exhibit higher levels of smoking at every age? Justify your answer.
# (4) The individuals in this study ranged in age from 16-97 years old. Do peope increase or decrease their volume of smoking as they get older? Justify your answer.
